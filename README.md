What to accomplish today:

Answer the following to tell the story of your machine learning model:

Which model type are you using?
Which dataset are you using?
Which platform are you using to analyze the data? jupyter vs colab vs ..
How/did you clean the data or prepare the data?
How did you fit the model to the data.
Which features were you looking at specifically in relation ot which other features (if applicable)?
How did the model perform?
    When applicable identify the following:
    1. Model accuracy in predicting or classifying target
    2. Model precision 
    3. r2 score
    4. f1 score
    5. auc and roc
    6. MAE, MSE, etc
Did you cross validate your model?
Did you use hyperparameter optimization?

How do we want our results to look? Meaning: Which metrics are important to identify and display, which visuals?
Comment your code, and make it concise when possible!.

What were some issues with your model, platform, data that you would like to improve?
What would you look into next given all the time and knowledge in the world?
