Questions:

-	Can wine score be predicted by review length/content?
-	Can wine type (red or white) be predicted based on chemical makeup?
-	Can wine price be predicted by review length/content, country, “province”, or variety?

What to accomplish today:<br>
<br>
Answer the following to tell the story of your machine learning model:<br>
<br>
Which model type are you using?<br>
Which dataset are you using?<br>
Which platform are you using to analyze the data? jupyter vs colab vs ..<br>
How/did you clean the data or prepare the data?<br>
How did you fit the model to the data.<br>
Which features were you looking at specifically in relation ot which other features (if applicable)?<br>
How did the model perform?<br>
    When applicable identify the following:<br><ol>
   <li> Model accuracy in predicting or classifying target</li>
   <li> Model precision </li>
    <li> r2 score</li>
    <li> f1 score </li>
    <li> auc and roc </li>
    <li> MAE, MSE, etc</li></ol><br>
Did you cross validate your model?<br>
Did you use hyperparameter optimization?<br>
<br><br>
How do we want our results to look? Meaning: Which metrics are important to identify and display, which visuals?<br><br>
Comment your code, and make it concise when possible!.<br>
<br><br>
What were some issues with your model, platform, data that you would like to improve?<br>
What would you look into next given all the time and knowledge in the world?<br>
